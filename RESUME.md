# About me
Due to the travelling experiences, I had with my parents when I was a child, I have a strong interest in both nature and society. I would never get tired of experiencing, studying, and creating new things. I travel, live in different countries, learn about the local environment and people and draw and write about what I see. 

I worked as a researcher for two years and as a designer for another two years. For me, they have an important common point, which is studying and creating new things, no matter that is about knowledge, ideas or the environment.

Some of my writing, and drawing about my research and design are shared on this website. I love feedback on any of these, so do not hesitate to reach out!
