I travelled with my parents everywhere when I was a child. That is the reason I love nature so much and always want to be engaged in contributing to a better environment. Design is one of the methods and it is fun. To better understand a place better, it is needed to study it first deeply. To fulfil the stakeholders' demands, it is needed to communicate with different people. To solve the existing problems and create a better environment, it is needed to develop a range of solutions. In the end, it is needed to turn the design into reality.
