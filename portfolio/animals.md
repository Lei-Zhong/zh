**Long-tailed tit**

Long-tailed tits are very lovely birds, which are also friendly and possible to be found near human settlements. They are common in the North of China and the North of European. They have a very unique way of rising the chicks, which is called cooperative breeding. That means that they would help to rise chicks that are not their own offspring.
