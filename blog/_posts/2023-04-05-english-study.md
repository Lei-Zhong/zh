You are John, a young professional who has just moved to a new town for a job. You're excited about the opportunity, but also a bit nervous about starting over in a new place.

As you settle into your new apartment and start exploring the town, you realize that communicating with the locals is going to be a challenge. You don't speak the language very well, and you're struggling to understand the people you meet.

Your first big challenge comes when you try to order a coffee at a local cafe. 

As you enter the Cafe, the barista greets you and asks you, "Welcome to our cafe! What can I get for you today?"

You look at the Menu and say, "..."

**///Your Challenge///**

Maybe you stumble over your words and mispronounce some key phrases, and the barista seems confused and frustrated.

Feeling embarrassed, you decide to take action. You search online for an English language learning blog and try to learn more vocabulary for the cafe as well as practice your conversational skills.

With each exercise you complete, you feel more confident and capable of communicating with the locals.

As you are back to the local Cafe, you approach the counter and greet the barista.

"Hi, I'd like a coffee please," you say, feeling a bit nervous.

"Sure, what kind of coffee would you like?" the barista asks.

"I'll have a cappuccino, please," you say.

"Sure thing. Would you like that to go or for here?" the barista asks.

"For here, please," you say.

"Great. And would you like anything else with that?" the barista asks.

"No, just the cappuccino, please," you answer.

"Alright, that'll be $3.00. You can pay at the register over there," the barista says, pointing to the register.

You pay for your coffee and take a seat at one of the tables. Enjoying your coffee, you feel confident and satisfied.
