Making a personal website is not that complicated.
{:.lead}

It took me two days to make this website, from zero to at least working. It was easier than I thought but I wouldn't say I know how to build a website from Zero. Thanks to Google, ChatPGT, GitHub, the template provider and all the others that contribute to it. Nowadays, we have many tools to build a simple website already. Maybe Laziness is the biggest push for technique advance indeed.

Here I would like to share with you about how I made it, from [where to start](#where-to-start) to [the platforms for making websites](#platform-for-making-website), [GitHub and template searching](#github-and-template-searching). 

## Where to Start
By searching on Google or asking ChatGPT. These are the easiest tool for you to prepare yourself with some basic information about website construction. For a simple personal website, you can use a professional platform to help you, although it may cost some money. Platforms such as WordPress (I also try this one, it is pretty good and easy), Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly. But if you decide to make a website free, then building a website in GitHub is a good idea. 

## Platforms for Making Websites
Platforms such as WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly, are strong tools for building website and are beginner friendly. One only needs to choose a suitable template and modify the content on it. But to publish the website, you will need a host service, which is always required to be paid.  

## GitHub and Template Searching
For building a website on GitHub, it is necessary to have some basic knowledge of GitHub itself. First, make an account for GitHub, then follow the [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to learn some basic ideas about how to use GitHub, and then find a website template from [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). The rest will be working on making the template into your website.

That's all. 


###### Notes: 

1. Paying to make a website is not complicated, you can always use one of those platforms. If you decided to make your website without paying, you can also try GitHub. If you find trouble in making a website, no matter if it is about the operation or the visualization, you are welcome to contact me.
