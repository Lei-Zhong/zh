**Project Description**

**162 000 ㎡**

**A Low-carbon and ecological campus**

**2021.10-present**

<sub>Meeting special requirement for Low Carbon, Green Campus, Living Building Challenge</sub>

<sub>Creating a comprehensive ecological campus strategy according to the current ecological environment</sub>

<sub>Applying to local ecological and cultural elements</sub>

The school is located in Baishiling, Xili Lake Science and
Education Town, Nanshan District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong
Province, China. Sitting on the mountains, it was a rare urban
paradise. However, due to the continuous opening and
utilization of this area for many years, the land surface has been
changing from forests, to the farmland, and then to the factories. 
Now, a new college jointly run by well-known Chinese and
foreign universities will be built here. How to use the existing
mountain forest resources, restore the local ecology, and build a
new urban paradise campus is the main proposition of this
project.
