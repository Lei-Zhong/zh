**Project Description**

**230 000 „é°**

**A ecological park with a history as a zoo**

This project is located in the city centre of Harbin, China. It is a reconstruction 
project of the Science Park of Harbin Institute of Technology. It is one of the rare 
open green spaces in the city centre, providing recreation for the citizen as well as 
providing important ecology services for the city.

This project focused on the restoration and creation of local habitats by studying 
their characteristics and species. In this project, six special types of habitats 
are the targets: forest, shrub-grassland, meadow, wetland, water-body habitats 
and habitat in/on the buildings. Through the restoration of vegetation, terrain 
construction, limitation of human activities (including traffic guidance, tips for 
visiting, arrangements of social activities), we aim at creating ideal habitats for 
Wild Animals in the city as well as constructing a harmonious Ecological park 
where humans and animals can coexist.
